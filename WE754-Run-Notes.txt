WE754 Run Notes

=====================================================================================================
Exercise 1. Web service encryption and digital signatures

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
• Configure a multi-protocol gateway to decrypt and encrypt an XML message
• Configure a multi-protocol gateway to verify and sign an XML message
• Test encryption and digital signatures by using the SoapUI tool

Import the BookingServiceProxy service
- generate keys, certs, Crypto objects
- WS-Security: signing, verification, encrypting, decrypting

1.1. Initialize the lab environment

1.2. Create cryptographic objects
Upload the files:  <lab_files>/WSSecurity/
KeysFromClient-sscert.pem
KeysFromDP
- KeysFromDP-privkey.pem
- KeysFromDP-sscert.pem	(Expires 8/3/18)

1.3. Import the BookingServiceProxy service
BookingServiceProxy HTTP_12nn1 - 12991 (imported value)
_4. Use SoapUI to test the service
*** actually tests backend service, not the one just imported
*** see WE751-Prep-Notes.txt for details of SOAPUI WSS keystore setup

1.4. Configure BookingServiceProxy to verify a signed message
SOAPUI sends signed request => DataPower verifies / sends on => WebService (FlyServices)
WebService (FlyServices) response => DataPower signs => SOAPUI verifies.

Get DP verifying SOAPUI signed message first:
Rule with matching URL
/BookingService/sign - actually verifies!

1.5. Test the BookingServiceProxy signature verification

1.6. Configure BookingServiceProxy to sign a message
DataPower takes the response from the backend and signs it for the SOAPUI to verify.
The BookingResponse_Transform.xsl seems irrelevant and the exercise notes don't make sense.

1.7. Test that the BookingServiceProxy sends a signed message
Althought a WSS Verify is placed in SOAPUI (Incoming WSS), there is nothing in this
exercise that tests verification failure.

1.8. Configure BookingServiceProxy to decrypt a message
Add decrypt to same 'singing' rule.

1.9. Test the BookingServiceProxy message decryption
Using probe, can see the encrypted message coming in from SOAPUI, and the decrypted message.

 1.10. Configure BookingServiceProxy to encrypt the response message
 
 1.11. Test the BookingServiceProxy message encryption
 
 1.12. Examine the rule processing by using the multi-step probe
 =====================================================================================================
Exercise 2. Configuring a web service proxy
After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
• Configure a web service proxy to virtualize an existing web service
• Configure the service policy within the web service proxy
<wsp_proxy_port>: 12nn5
***  also <wsp_booking_port> in notes
2.1. Create a web service proxy for the Booking Service web service
BookingServiceWSProxy BookingServiceWSProxyFSH 12995
FlyServices 9080
Disable response validation on port-operation: BookTravel
actual backend response has elements in the wrong order.

2.3. Test the web service proxy processing

2.4. Add an operation-level rule to BookingServiceWSProxy

2.5 Test the web service proxy processing with a Transform rule
response: ConfirmationCode => ConfirmationText

2.6. Configure message decryption on the web service proxy

2.7. Test the web service proxy processing with decryption added
2.8. Use the probe to observe the encrypted request message processing
See SOAPUI http log to see encrypted message being sent.
Request rule does not show the incoming encrypted messages, since
the decryption is happening at proxy level before entering rule.
