WE754 need to add folder
- <lab_files>/WSSecurity
from:
- we7541labfiles

Need to update from updated-keys:
DataPower:
- WSSecurity/KeysFromDP-sscert.pem
- WSSecurity/KeysFromDP-privkey.pem

Ubuntu / used by SOAPUI:
- /usr/labfiles/dp/WSSecurity/Client.jks
-right-click SOPAUI BookingServices project:
  - Show Project View / WS-Security Configurations / Keystores
  - ensure entry that references above file

The following does not require any changes as they are
